### Leanne de Goeij a.k.a. LeaBits
(I've chosen this nickname when I was younger, don't judge)

I'm a teacher at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences, but currently also studying at the University of Amsterdam.

Most of my repositories are private (sorry, not sorry). You can view some of my projects on my portfolio website.
